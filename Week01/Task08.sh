Step 4: Summary of Critical Vulnerabilities
- Identify Critical Vulnerabilities:
Focus on vulnerabilities marked as Critical or High. Note their CVEs and descriptions.
Suggested Mitigation Measures:

For each critical vulnerability, provide suggested actions:
Patch Software: Update the affected application or service to the latest version.
Configuration Changes: Modify settings to secure the application (e.g., disabling unused services).
Firewall Rules: Implement firewall rules to restrict access to vulnerable services.
Network Segmentation: Isolate vulnerable systems from the rest of the network.
Example Summary Format
Critical Vulnerability: CVE-XXXX-XXXX
Description: Brief description of the vulnerability.
Suggested Mitigation:
Update the software to the latest version.
Apply specific configuration changes as recommended.
Final Notes
